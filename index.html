							<h2>Psychotherapy with Children, Adolescents, Adults and Families</h2>

						<p>
							Are you suffering emotionally? Are you having trouble functioning at work or in your relationships?
						<br>
						<br>
						
						My goal is to understand what you are struggling with
							and together, over time, we will figure out what you need.
							It can be hard to look at oneself due to feelings of fear, shame, and guilt.
							I will be very interested in understanding what you are contending with, and will strive to help you.
							I have many tools that can be helpful for understanding yourself and conducting your therapy.
						<br>
						<br>
							I invite you to look through my website and contact me if you have any questions or if you are interested in working with me.</p>

							<h1>My Approach</h1>
						</header>
						<p>
							Central to my work is developing a strong connection with each of my patients.
							I make use of multiple psychological points of view, including psychodynamic,
							cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, and developmental perspectives.
							I endeavor to tailor our work to our evolving understanding of what you need.
							<br>
							<br>
							In therapy, I will treat you with empathy, genuineness, respect and non-judgmental regard. We will
							work as a team to understand and deal with your challenges. I will expect you to actively engage in the
							therapy process. When we encounter difficulties and obstacles during the process, I will do my best to
							help you overcome them so that your goals can be realized.
							<br>
							<br>
							I would like to work with you to help you achieve higher functioning, grow your potential, and feel
							happy with your life. People grow as a result of experiencing mistakes and failures, often from
							emotional pain. I will strive to help you navigate your challenges with emotional poise. I hope that you
							will be able to make positive changes to your life as result of the therapy process.

						<h3>Entering Therapy</h3>
						<p>
							Initially we would meet to clarify your current issues prior to discussing a potential treatment plan. 
							In other words, assessment precedes treatment. Of course, if you are in crisis when you come to see me, 
							that would be the highest priority.
						</p>
						<h3>Scheduling Therapy</h3>
						<p>
							We will meet often enough for the treatment to be effective, and it t is often most helpful to regularly
							 schedule appointments.
						</p>
						<h3>Fees and Insurance</h3>
						<p>
							I am happy to discuss my fees and fee policy on the phone or at our initial meetings. I will bill you directly. 
							I am not contracted with any insurance company as an in-network provider. If your insurance policy 
							covers out-of-network services, my statement will provide enough information for you to submit a claim to your 
							insurance company so that they can reimburse your therapy. In any case, I will need to receive payment from you directly. 
							In my San Francisco office, I will accept patients through the SF Private Practice Network.
